# Introduction

Welcome to **AI-Assisted Coding** — a practical guide to writing better software with AI tools.

## What is AI-Assisted Coding?

AI-assisted coding uses large language models (LLMs) to help you write, review, debug, and refactor code. These tools can act as a pair programmer that's available 24/7.

## What You'll Learn

- **Core Concepts** — Tokens, context windows, temperature, system prompts, and tool use
- **Prompt Engineering** — How to communicate effectively with AI coding tools
- **Tools & Workflows** — Setting up and using AI tools in your development environment
- **Best Practices** — Writing reliable software with AI assistance
- **Exercises** — Hands-on practice applying AI-assisted coding techniques

## Who This Is For

- Developers looking to integrate AI tools into their workflow
- Teams evaluating AI coding assistants
- Anyone curious about the practical side of AI-assisted development

## Getting Started

Start with [Core Concepts](/category/core-concepts) to understand how AI coding tools work under the hood, then explore [Tools & Workflows](/category/tools--workflows) to set up your environment and [Prompt Engineering](/category/prompt-engineering) to learn how to get the most out of your AI tools. When you're ready to put it all together, try the [Exercises](/category/exercises) for hands-on practice.
