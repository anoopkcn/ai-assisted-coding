# Introduction

![Slug mascot](/img/slug_mascot.svg)

<!-- Welcome to **AI-Assisted Coding**, a practical guide to writing code with AI. -->

<!-- ## What is AI-Assisted Coding? -->

AI-assisted coding uses large language models (LLMs) to help you write, review, debug, and refactor code.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Core Concepts](/category/core-concepts)** Tokens, context windows, temperature, system prompts, and tool use
- **[Tools & Workflows](/category/tools--workflows)** Setting up and using AI tools in your development environment
- **[Prompt Engineering](/category/prompt-engineering)** How to communicate effectively with AI coding tools
- **[Best Practices](/category/best-practices)** Writing reliable software with AI assistance
- **[Exercises](/category/exercises)** Hands-on practice applying AI-assisted coding techniques to a dummy problem

## Outcomes

After working through this documentation, you should be able to:

- Explain how tokens, context windows, and system instructions affect model behavior
- Prompt coding agents with clear constraints and verifiable done criteria
- Run safer AI-assisted workflows with checkpoints, tests, and code review
- Choose tools and execution modes based on the task, risk, and level of autonomy needed

## Who This Is For

- Anyone curious about the practical side of AI-assisted development
- Developers looking to integrate AI tools into their workflow
- Teams evaluating AI coding assistants

## Suggested Learning Paths

| Audience | Start Here | Then Read |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| New to AI coding tools | [Core Concepts](/category/core-concepts) | [Prompt Engineering](/category/prompt-engineering) -> [Best Practices](/category/best-practices) |
| Working developers adopting tools now | [Tools & Workflows](/category/tools--workflows) | [Best Practices](/category/best-practices) -> [Exercises](/category/exercises) |
| Team leads and enablement owners | [Best Practices](/category/best-practices) | [Tools & Workflows](/category/tools--workflows) -> [Core Concepts](/category/core-concepts) |

## Getting Started

Start with [Core Concepts](/category/core-concepts) to understand how AI coding tools work under the hood, then explore [Tools & Workflows](/category/tools--workflows) to set up your environment and [Prompt Engineering](/category/prompt-engineering) to learn how to get the most out of your AI tools. When you're ready to put it all together, try the [Exercises](/category/exercises) for hands-on practice.
