# Exercises

## Why Practice Matters

Reading about AI-assisted coding is useful — but building something with it is where real learning happens. These exercises put you in realistic scenarios where you'll use AI tools to solve problems, write tests, and ship working code.

Each exercise is designed to practice specific techniques from the documentation sections. You'll alternate between writing prompts, reviewing AI output, running tests, and committing your work — just like a real development workflow.

## How the Exercises Work

Each exercise follows a progressive structure:

1. **You get a starting point** — a problem description and some starter code
2. **You build the rest with AI** — using the prompting, review, and workflow techniques from this guide
3. **Each task maps to a documentation section** — so you can reference the concepts as you go
4. **Solutions are provided** — including recommended prompts, expected code, and self-assessment criteria

The exercises emphasize **test-driven development**: you write tests first with AI help, then implement code to make them pass. This mirrors how experienced developers use AI tools in practice.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** installed
- **An AI coding tool** set up and working (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or similar)
- **git** installed and basic familiarity with version control
- **uv** package manager ([install instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

## Available Exercises
