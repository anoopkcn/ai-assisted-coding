## Choosing the Right Tool

Consider these factors when picking an AI coding tool:

- **Inline vs. chat** — Do you want autocomplete-style suggestions or a conversational interface?
- **Context handling** — How much of your codebase can the tool understand at once?
- **Language support** — Some tools work better with certain languages
- **Privacy** — Where does your code get sent? Can you use a local model?
