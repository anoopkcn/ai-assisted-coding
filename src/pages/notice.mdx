<Admonition type="info" title="Data and Privacy Policy">
Before using any AI-assisted coding tool, verify the data and privacy policies that apply on your machine and within your organisation. Understand how your code, prompts, and context data are collected, stored, and processed. Some tools may transmit code snippets or telemetry to external servers. 
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Tool Licensing">
Check the licence terms for every AI-assisted coding tool you use. Ensure your usage complies with both the tool's licence and any applicable software licensing obligations.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="AI Policy for Contributing Projects">
When contributing to a repository or project, review its AI policy before using AI-generated code in your contributions. Many open-source projects and organisations have specific guidelines on whether and how AI-assisted contributions are accepted. Some may require disclosure of AI usage, while others may restrict it entirely. Always respect the project's contribution guidelines and be transparent about the use of AI tools in your work.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Environmental Impact and Cost">
Consider the environmental impact and financial cost of using AI-assisted coding tools. Large language models require significant computational resources, which translate to energy consumption and carbon emissions. Be mindful of unnecessary or excessive API calls, and use AI assistance intentionally rather than reflexively. Where possible, choose efficient workflows.
